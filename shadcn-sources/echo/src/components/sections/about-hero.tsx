          <p>
            I&apos;ve been writing code for several years now, working across
            both frontend and backend. My focus is on creating products that
            balance clean design, solid architecture, and great user experience.
          </p>

          <p>
            I care about clarity, simplicity, and craftsmanship — not just in
            code, but in how things feel to use. I like tools that are
            lightweight and flexible, and I believe that the best products are
            the ones that stay out of the user&apos;s way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Hey — I&apos;m John, a full-stack developer who loves turning ideas
            into real, working products. I enjoy the craft of building — the
            small details that make software feel thoughtful, fast, and alive.
